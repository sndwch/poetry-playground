# Poetry Playground - Ideas & TODO

Personal notes for experimental features and improvements.

## Feature Ideas (Not Started)

### Export & Integration
- **Corpus Export Formats** - JSON/CSV export for poetry analysis, batch generation workflows
- **Web Interface/API** - Flask/FastAPI with `/generate`, `/analyze` endpoints for easier access

### Generation Improvements
- **Smart Layout Engine** - Better visual poem layout algorithms with whitespace optimization, non-overlapping placement
- **Transformer Model Integration** - GPT-2/DistilGPT-2 for coherent stanza generation
- **Theme and Concept Explorer** - Brainstorming assistant for thematic clusters using ConceptNet/Wikipedia APIs
- **Prompt and Constraint Generator** - Oulipian writing constraints and creative prompts
- **Mood and Register Mapping** - Emotional intelligence for word selection

### Architecture & Tooling
- **Better Logging & Debugging** - `--log-level DEBUG/INFO/WARN` flag, structured logging
- **Plugin System** - Modular architecture for custom generators
- **Corpus Analyzer Dashboard** - Per-book signatures with bigrams, sentiment, POS rhythms. HTML export

### Advanced Experiments
- **Evolutionary Ship of Theseus++** - Treat poem as genome with fitness functions (meter, rhyme, semantic distance)
- **Six Degrees → Story Scaffolds** - Generate 3-beat or 5-beat narrative arcs
- **Interactive & Multimodal Features** - Visual editor, text-on-image backgrounds, audio generation

## Grammatical Templates - Remaining Work

From the original Feature 12a (currently functional but could be extended):
- Phase 5: Multi-template selection (variety across batches)
- Phase 6: Interactive template refinement
- Phase 7: User-defined custom templates

## Notes

Most features from the original project are already implemented and working. This is just a list of ideas that weren't finished in the original fork.
